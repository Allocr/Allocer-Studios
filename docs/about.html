  <h1>About Me </h1>
  <p>I am a front-end web developer/graphic designer by the name Allocer. 
    This is the page where I go into more depth about who I am and my history in web development.</p>
    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>Back in 2020, I was introduced to a website called Melonking.net. It was a personal website created for the sole purpose of
    showing melonking's hobbies and interests. I grew very fond of the chaotic/diy nature of the website, and decided to make my own.
    I used Neocities to create a website, and have been building on my skills in web development since then.</p> 
    
    <h2>My Professional Work</h2>
    <p>In 2023, a local support group by the name of ACA required a website for the greater new orleans area. I stepped up to
    the challenge and supplied them with a website that they are still using to this day. 
    <br><br>In 2024, one of my clients wanted their film portfolio website redone. I volunteered to build it for them to their
    great satisfaction
    <br><br>In the present moment, I am working on assembling this website, Allocer Studios, as a demonstration of my abilities as a 
    graphic designer and web developer. I hope to continue improving my abilities to the satisfaction of my clients.
