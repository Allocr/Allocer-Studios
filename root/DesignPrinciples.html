  <h1>My Design Principles </h1>
  <p>Over the course of learning web development, I have acquired a list of principles and ideas about how it should be done and why.
    This page gives insight into those ideas.
  </p>
  <h2>First Principle: Simplicity</h2>
  <p>I like keeping my websites simple and straightforward. The more complex a website is the easier it gets to make things
    unintuitive, slow to navigate, and unsecure. By keeping things simple, I limit the frustration a user can experience on the website,
    added frustration when building/modifying the website, and weak spots hackers can exploit.
  </p>

  <h2>Second Principle: Style</h2>
  <p>
    I like my websites with a little bit of style. Making them distinctive is half of the job, and I do this in the same way lots
    of indie game developers make their games pop; through stylized graphics. Making art with a distinctive look and feel is a great
    way of differentiating yourself, while modifying what is already present to look different rather than adding onto what's already there.
  </p>

  <h2>Third Principle: DIY</h2>
  <p>
    My websites are made from scratch. I do not use templates, web content management systems, or art from other people unless
    explicitly told to do so. Occasionally, I will use generators to provide me with what I need, and I have my own templates which
    I use frequently. For the most part however, I am typing out the lines of code in Code OSS manually. This ensures I know exactly
    what goes on a website, and allows me greater control over how it is built.
